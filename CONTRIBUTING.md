## Submitting Issues

One of the best ways you can help Amethyst is to report bugs or request features
on our GitHub issue trackers. We can't fix problems we don't know about, so
please report frequently! Make sure to post your issue on the tracker most
relevant to you:

* [Amethyst Tracker][am]: Issues on the core game engine itself or the Amethyst
  Book.
* [Amethyst-CLI Tracker][ac]: Issues on the command-line project management
  tool.

[am]: https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst/issues
[ac]: https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_cli/issues

Before posting your issue, please take a moment to search the tracker's existing
issues first, as it's possible that someone else reported the same issue before
you. Though it helps save time, don't worry! We won't mind if you accidentally
post a duplicate issue.

When you are filling out your issue, please label it accordingly. These labels
help developers prioritize what they should work on next. All Amethyst issue
trackers use the same set of labels to mark each issue. Please select one (1)
label from each of the following three sections that is most relevant to your
issue:

1. **Diff**: How difficult do you think it is to resolve?
   * Hard (highest)
   * Medium
   * Easy (least)
2. **Pri**: Relatively speaking, how important is it?
   * Blocker (highest)
   * Critical
   * Important
   * Normal
   * Low (least)
3. **Type**: What kind of issue are you reporting?
   * Bug
     * A problem with the software.

   * Improvement
