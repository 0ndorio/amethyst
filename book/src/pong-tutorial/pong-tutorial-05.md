# Winning a Round and Keeping Score

Our last chapter ended on a bit of a cliffhanger. What happens when our ball
reaches the left or right edge of the screen? It just keeps going!

In this chapter, we'll fix that by putting the ball back into play after it
leaves either side of the Arena. We'll also add a scoreboard and keep track of
who's winning and losing!
