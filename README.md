This project is a *work in progress* and is very incomplete; pardon the dust!
Read a summary of what happened this past week at [*This Week in Amethyst*][tw].

## Vision

Amethyst aims to be a fast, data-oriented and data-driven game engine suitable
for rapid prototyping and iteration. It also tries to push the
[Rust programming language][rs] to its limits, driving further improvement and
hopefully attracting more game developers toward the young and vibrant Rust
ecosystem.

[rs]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

The engine's design draws much inspiration from the industrial-strength
[Bitsquid Engine][bs] (now called [Autodesk Stringray][sr]). However, Amethyst
does not aim to be API-compatible with it in any way. Some goals include:

[sr]: http://stingrayengine.com/

* Simple game state management in the form of a [pushdown automaton][pa].
* Massively parallel architecture, especially in rendering.
* [Correct entity-component-system model][em], with entities and prefabs largely
  defined in [YAML files][ya].
* Abstract scripting API that can be bound to a variety of embedded languages,
  such as [mruby][mr], [Lua][lu], etc.
* Renderer optimized for modern graphics APIs, e.g. Vulkan, Direct3D 12+, Metal.
* Traditional "mega-editor" split into several small but well-integrated tools,
  adhering to the [Unix philosophy][up].

## Usage

Read the [online book][bk] for a comprehensive tutorial to using Amethyst. There
is also an online crate-level [API reference][ar].

[bk]: http://ebkalderon.github.io/amethyst/
[ar]: http://ebkalderon.github.io/amethyst/doc/amethyst/

## Quick Example

See the [Getting Started][gs] chapter in the book for the full-blown "Hello,
World!" tutorial. For the sake of brevity, you can generate an empty game
project with the [amethyst_cli][ac] tool and build it. Follow along below:

[gs]: http://ebkalderon.github.io/amethyst/getting_started.html
[ac]: https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_cli

```
$ cargo install amethyst_cli
$ amethyst new mygame
$ cd mygame
$ amethyst run
```

If everything goes well, you should see "Hello from Amethyst!" print out to the
terminal and abruptly exit.

## Building Documentation

You can build the book locally with:

```
$ cargo install mdbook
$ mdbook build book
```

The text can be found in `book/html/index.html`. To generate the API
documentation locally, do:

```
$ cargo doc
```

The API reference can be found in `target/doc/amethyst/index.html`.
